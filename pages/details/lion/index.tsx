                    Lions are leaders. They are usually the bosses at
                    work&#8230; or at least they think they are! They are
                    decisive, bottom line folks who are observers, not watchers
                    or listeners. They love to solve problems. They are usually
                    individualists who love to seek new adventures and
                    opportunities.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Lions are very confident and self-reliant. In a group
                    setting, if no one else instantly takes charge, the Lion
                    will. Unfortunately, if they donâ€™t learn how to tone down
                    their aggressiveness, their natural dominating traits can
                    cause problems with others. Most entrepreneurs are strong
                    lions, or at least have a lot of lion in them.

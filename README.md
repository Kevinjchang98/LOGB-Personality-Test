## What is it?

All the test content and descriptions are originally from [mrfarshtey.net](http://mrfarshtey.net/Psychology/5minute_personality_test.doc). Originally developed from Smalley and Trent, 1999.

## How to use

Drag the cards in each set of four to reorder them. Reorder them to have the most relatable card on top and least relatable on the bottom. There are 10 sets of four cards total, and the scores will automatically update at the bottom.
